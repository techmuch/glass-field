",

",
    "
",
    "While traditional metrics track *what* happened, Glass-Field uses a neuro-symbolic approach to explain *why*. By converting tracking data into a relational graph and applying **PyReason** (a temporal logic framework), we treat the football field as a solvable logical system."

",
    "1. **Stage 0: Signal Intelligence** - Ingesting external priors (news, market data).
",
    "2. **Stage 1: Relational Map** - Transmuting CSV tracking data into GraphML.
",
    "3. **Stage 2: Reasoning** - Applying football axioms via the PyReason logic engine.
",
    "4. **Stage 3: Intelligence Output** - Generating structural vulnerability reports."

",

",
    "- Add more complex rules to `rules/offensive_spacing.txt` (e.g., coverage rotation, blitz pickups).
